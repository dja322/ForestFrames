      <h2>Team intro</h2>
      <h3>Team Lead & Server Manager: Dalton Tippings</h3>
      <p>
        Handles the general direction of the project, will lead most meetings and be the main point of 
        contact for our clients and others. Also, primarily responsible for managing the server and 
        decisions related to it, may be the primary coder for this aspect. Primary overseer of code 
        modifications related to this.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>
        Citizen science intiatives while mostly successful in more developed parts of the world,
        have fallen short at collecting data in less explored places like the southern hemisphere.
        This is due mainly to a lack of modern hardware capabale of running citizen science software,
        but is also due to a lack of incetive for locals to go out and actually collect new data in there
        communities.
      </p> 
      <h3>The solution</h3>
      <p>
        Our projects work load has been split into two capstone groups, group 2 and group 3. 
        Together we have been tasked to create a citizen science app that can run on older hardware
        to collect data from less explored areas of the southern hemisphere. Our app is designed
        to verify collected data and contribute that information to other scientific databases. 
        Once a users data is verified, users could be provided incentives to go out 
        and collect information in there communities.
      </p>

      <h2>High level requirements</h2>
      <p>The current high priority requirements that we are working towards</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Small and efficient app that users can have on their phones</li>
        <li>Compatability with older phones</li>
        <li>Allow user to enter requested data and upload it</li>
        <li>Verify that uploaded data is usable and trustworthy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is the overview of how we as a team intend on iterate and develop our product.
        We hope to devlop a feature and have our clients, either those that will use our
        app or our clients themseleves review what we develop and ensure it is what they want.
        We will then refine/devlop the developed feature further and then move onto another
        feature where we will begin the process again.
      </p>

      <h2>Envisioned solution</h2>

      <p>
        We will initially work on a basic app so that a user can interface with our system.
        We then have a server that is where all data will be routed through, it will connect to our
        database and also be analyzed by Team 2 and Team 3 to ensure the data is usabele and valid.
        The end goal of this project is once the data is verified to be trustworthy, the person who
        uploaded the data will recieve compensation. As more aspects of our project are desgined
        and implemented, this description will grow and more detailed diagrams will be implemented.
