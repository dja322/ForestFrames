      <p>Welcome to website of "Forest Frames", a 2024-25 NAU Computer Science Capstone team.</p>

        <h2>What is Forest Frames?</h3>
        <p>
          Forest Frames is a group out of NAU that is focused on developing software that helps provide 
          and verify rarely cataloged ecological data. The overall goal is to gather data from these 
          places through Citizen Science, where those local to those areas send in that data, and since 
          incentives would be used, verification of this data is crucial to ensure fair compensation and 
          data accuracy. The group's main goals are to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>provide an application that allows users to record and send their data</li>
          <li>verify the data collected from users</li>
          <li>organize/format the data to then be used with other ecological technologies</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The team works with another Capstone group
          <a href="https://ceias.nau.edu/capstone/projects/CS/2025/DataIntegrity_F24/">
          (Data Integrity)</a>, along with their <a href="team.html#mentor">mentor</a> and 
          <a href="team.html#sponsorMembers">sponsors</a> to accomplish these goals.
